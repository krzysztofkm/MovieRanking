The main goal was to design the APS NET MVC application which takes data from external API and store user ratings in local DB.
All assumptions are implemented except one: Issue on my environment doesn't allow create the migration script. I've decided to create a table manually in DB.

TODO:
-> Change DB from a Sqlite to the SQL Server
-> Add an error handling
-> Add logging framework
